Pandas ==============================

[<start>:<end>]
[<start>:<end>:<step>]


.Series(<List>,index=<List for Lables>) => creating Series

> Length of Index list is the length of series
> It is also like dictnory when accesing via index.

.read_csv('CSV FILE PATH')

.loc[<row-start-name>:<row-end-name>,<col-start-name>:<col-end-name>] - Here last element is Included in loc
.iloc[<row-start>:<row-end>,<col-start>:<col-end>] - Here last element is Discluded


.head(<nrows>) -> first 5 rows
.tail(<nrows>) -> last 5 rows

.info() -> Gives the outline of your DataFrame such as colname,their non null values,datatypes

.drop([<Row Index>]) -> Remove the Row [NOT INPLACE]

.dropna() -> This function removes the rows containing the Nan or null values [This is not inplace but we can change it to inplace to true]
    parms
        | subset -> Only Colums to checked for Nan
        | inplace -> take effect on same Dtaframe

.fillna() -> If we encounter a Nan it will fill the respective value. [Best Pratice is to fill only the Numeric columns] [This is not inplace but we can change it to inplace to true]
    Ex -> df[<Column Name>].fillna(130);

NOTE: if we access Elements from data frame we can get acces to function like '.mean() .median() .mode()'

.duplicated() -> gives a series with True if row is Repeated
.drop_duplicates() -> Drops the duplicated rows.


.corr() -> Return dataframe with correlations of Datframe

.replace(<From>,<to>) -> Same works as Replce function
